      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 2, 2024</p>
      <p>
        HYMN BOOK ("we", "our", or "us") operates the HYMN BOOK mobile
        application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding
        the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our
        App.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
      <p>
        We do not collect any personal data from users. Our App does not require
        you to provide any personal information, such as your name, email
        address, phone number, or payment information. Additionally, we do not
        collect any data regarding your device or its usage of the App.
      </p>

      <h2>No Login Required</h2>
      <p>
        Our App does not require you to create an account or log in. You can use
        the App's full functionality without providing any personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Since our App does not collect any data, we do not share any user
        information with third-party services. There are no third-party
        analytics, advertising, or tracking tools integrated into our App.
      </p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our App does not target or knowingly collect any information from
        children under the age of 13. Since no data is collected, there is no
        risk of compromising children's privacy.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
        reflected on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy
        periodically for any updates.
