      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 22, 2026</p>

      <p>
        HYMN BOOK ("we", "our", or "us") operates the HYMN BOOK mobile
        application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding
        the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our
        App.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
      <p>
        We do not require users to create an account or provide personal
        information such as name, email address, phone number, or payment
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, our App uses <strong>Google Analytics for Firebase</strong>,
        a service provided by Google LLC, to help us understand how users
        interact with the App and to improve user experience and performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Google Analytics for Firebase may automatically collect certain
        information, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device type and operating system</li>
        <li>App usage data (such as screens viewed and features used)</li>
        <li>General geographic location (country or region level)</li>
        <li>App performance data and crash reports</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This information is collected in aggregated and anonymized form. We do
        not use this data to personally identify users.
      </p>

      <p>
        For more information on how Google handles data, please review
        Google’s Privacy Policy:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">
          https://policies.google.com/privacy
        </a>
      </p>

      <h2>No Login Required</h2>
      <p>
        Our App does not require you to create an account or log in. You can use
        the App's full functionality without directly providing personal
        information.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        We use Google Analytics for Firebase for analytics and app performance
        monitoring. We do not use third-party advertising services, and we do
        not sell, rent, or trade user data.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not share personally identifiable information with third parties.
        Analytics data collected through Google Analytics for Firebase is
        processed according to Google's privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Deletion Requests</h2>
      <p>
        Since we do not collect or store personally identifiable information,
        there is no personal data maintained by us that can be deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish to request deletion of analytics-related data, you may:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uninstall the App from your device</li>
        <li>Clear the App data from your device settings</li>
        <li>Contact us at [your-email@example.com]</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our App does not target children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
        collect personally identifiable information from children. Any analytics
        data collected is non-personal and used only in aggregate form to improve
        the App.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We value your trust and strive to use commercially acceptable means to
        protect information collected through analytics tools. However, no
        method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100%
        secure.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
        reflected on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy
        periodically for any updates.
      </p>
